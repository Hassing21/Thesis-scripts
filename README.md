Scripts for Master_Thesis_CryptoSentiment

Note on Data Availability and Scripts

The final processed DataFrame used for model training (Final_df_features_sentiment.csv) is included in this repository for reproducibility. However, the original raw data sources (such as Twitter and financial news sentiment datasets) are excluded due to size limitations.
Please also note that several intermediate processing scripts and steps are not included in this repository, as they were used for internal preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, filtering, and merging. The main modelling and evaluation scripts are provided to ensure full replication of the key analysis steps.
